The other, which I don't understand too well, which I'd appreciate your clarifying first, I assume your experts went out and they said, this is how much water falls in Georgia or comes into Georgia every year, and we'll subtract from that the water that evaporates, and we end up with a number that they must be using, and that's a lot. And the other side says, well, let's go out and measure what they're actually using. And they went and measured it, and that was a little. And between the two, there's a lot of disappearing water. Where does it go? And why? I mean, you have the burden of clear and convincing evidence.

In part for reasons others have expressed, that would not be predictable. It would be hard for courts to do that, wouldn't necessarily be equitable, given the number of courts who would be involved hearing similarly situated plaintiffs. Rather, I viewed the doctrine at least as it's been articulated as reflecting a general foreign policy concern, and then the question becomes the particulars of the doctrine. And I had understood the argument to be that, if foreign defendants harm foreign parties in a foreign country and remedies are available in the foreign country, then American courts should usually abstain.

The problem for us is, is this more like Baker v. Selden, where they said the accounting is not, it's a method of operation? Or is it more like an ordinary computer program? All right. Now what I got out of reading through this very good briefing is, look, Java's people divided the universe of tasks, of which there are billions, in a certain way. All the things that tell the computer to do one of those things, we'll do. But that which tells the computer which to do, that's the declaration. Here is what it's like. It's like, as Judge Boudin said, the QWERTY keyboard. You didn't have to have a QWERTY keyboard on typewriters at the beginning, but, my God, if you let somebody have a copyright on that now, they would control all typewriters, which really has nothing to do with copyright. Or it's like switchboards on old-fashioned telephone systems. You could have done it in 1,000 ways. But, once you did it, all those operators across the world learned that system, and you don't want to give a copyright holder a monopoly of -- hmm -- telephone systems. Or it's like, to use the Chief Justice's example, a chef who figures out brilliant ways of mixing spices and then putting the spices for this and that in a certain order on a shelf, and then he writes something that tells you which shelf to go to and which shelf to pick out -- and which spice to pick out for which dish. Now all those things are somewhat ordinary programs, but they also are doing something. They're giving you an instruction as to how to call up those programs that reflect Java's organization. And at this point in time, it's really tough, just like the QWERTY keyboard, to go backwards, and very bad consequences will flow if you don't see that distinction. Okay?

I know there was a Third Circuit decision earlier on in the 1980s. But the other circuits moved away from that. They and the entire computer world have not tried to analogize computer codes to other methods of expression because it's sui generis. They've looked at its functions, and they've said the API, the Application Programming Interface, of which the declaring code is a part, is not copyrightable. Implementing codes are. And on that understanding, industries have built up around applications that know they can -- they can copy only what's necessary to run on the application, but they have to change everything else. That's what Google did here. That's why it took less than 1 percent of the Java code. So I guess that's the way the world has run in every other system. Whether it's Apple's desktop or Amazon's web services, everybody knows that APIs are not -- declaring codes are not copyrightable. Implementing codes are.

A lot of the states -- not a lot, but some were objecting in a whole variety of complex ways. And so Congress passed the Natural Gas Act. Now they couldn't have built the pipelines unless they had this power, I think, I'm not certain of that, but I don't see how they could have because they need -- go look at the map on the -- the map of waterways in which Pennsylvania claims an interest in the Marcellus Shale Coalition. They zone water beds. They own all kinds of obstacles. But this was passed to build a pipeline. How could they have done it? I don't see it. And having known a little bit about that, since you need the federal power or a government power to -- for a private person to use eminent domain for anything against a private land or by a state, I don't understand how they would have -- how any reasonable person would have delegated any eminent-domain power to the Natural Gas Act, which was for interstate pipelines, without including the power to proceed against the state. Am I right about that? And, if I am right and, therefore, it is clearly in this statute, why in heaven's name can't the Federal Power Commission then, or FERC now, have done the same thing? And if they could have done the same thing under law of Congress, why can't they hire somebody, just as Mississippi hires private prosecutors sometimes in criminal cases?

And if it's the opposite, you say the opposite, is there substantial evidence. And if the judge doesn't say, Congress tells us what to do. Presume that he's telling the truth, but the presumption is rebuttable, so if nobody says anything, you look at it and you simply say, assuming it was rebutted, we assume that the judge found it was rebutted, and is there substantial evidence? Period. With the assumption that it was rebutted. And that could include, there isn't enough evidence to show it was rebutted. That will just be part of the matter. But what we tell the court of appeals is review substantial evidence, follow the statute as I said, end of -- end of case."

That's a form of a lack of persuasiveness. There are situations in which people can be credible about one aspect of something but not another. This is a perfect case. Dai may have been credible about the persecution of his wife and the fact that they were forced to abort a child but incredible as to why he left China and whether it was based on the fear of persecution or not. That his wife went back, all the things you mentioned could be viewed that way. There are any dozen reasons. Are we responsible for figuring out what the BIA meant?

I'm baffled by the distinction that you're drawing between ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness."" And it's not actually consistent with the way that I've seen cases come up for review in the court of appeals from IJs who make adverse credibility determinations. The ones I've seen, you know, they've essentially been equivalent to saying that the witness is lying. This -- this fine distinction between ""believable"" and ""believed"" just seems, you know, nitpicking to me. As Justice Kavanaugh was saying, it seems to me more like ""credibility"" refers to are they lying, and then ""persuasiveness,"" as Justice Kavanaugh was suggesting, points to other reasons why you might not believe them. So I could -- you know, thinking about your example with the child and the crumbs, I was thinking as you talked about an example about my child. I come home and find the child hysterically crying, and she said someone was beating at the door, I think somebody was trying to break into her house -- our house. And I can believe her. I don't think she's lying. But then my neighbor says, yeah, you know, I -- I saw it was the UPS man. So I would not find her story persuasive, not because of credibility but because there was other evidence that showed she was not, in fact, in danger. It was the UPS deliveryman. So I don't think that -- you -- you seem to be leaning heavily on the fact that the statute uses both the words ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness,"" and I just don't see it. So I want to ask you what's wrong with seeing it this way: that the IJ makes a determination about credibility, and that has to be express, and when it gets up to the Board, there are two ways in which the Board might have to confront this presumption. Either the IJ actually found the alien incredible and the Board disagrees, in which case it has to confront the presumption and explain why it thinks the evidence rebuts that presumption of credibility, or the IJ might not have done a good enough job in making an adverse credibility determination explicit, as the statute requires, and then, still, the Board has to presume credibility and then explain why it thinks the presumption is rebutted. If the Board offers such an explanation, once it gets up to the court of appeals, the court of appeals isn't applying any kind of presumption. The court of appeals is just reviewing it for substantial evidence and seeing if the Board's explanation -- and the Board has to show that it understood what presumption should be there -- whether the Board's explanation was rational and substantial evidence supported its determination that the alien was not telling the truth. Is that an okay way to think about it, and how is that different from your way?"

But, if you give them appeals in the middle of the case, too often you will really muck up the system, take too long. And so we allow some things to go ahead even though there was no appeal and it might be unfair and wrong because we don't want to muck up the system.

So you're not going to waste a lot of time; it's in the court of appeals anyway. You'll waste some time if you let them have other things.

It's a very -- you know it's very sensitive, controversial. There are strong -- very strong feelings on all sides that warrant respect. And it seems like we and governments should be looking, where possible, for win-win answers, recognizing that neither side is going to win completely on these issues given the First Amendment on the one hand and given Obergefell on the other. But, when I look at this case, that's not at all what happened here. It seems like Philadelphia created a clash, it seems, and was looking for a fight and has brought that serious, controversial fight all the way to the Supreme Court even though no same-sex couple had gone to CSS, even though 30 agencies are available for same-sex couples, and even though CSS would refer any same-sex couple to one of those other agencies. And to be clear, I fully appreciate the stigmatic harm. I completely understand that, fully appreciate it. But we need to find a balance that also respects religious beliefs. That was the promise explicitly written by the Court in Obergefell and in Masterpiece, explicitly promised that respect for religious beliefs.

So, if I understood what Mr. Carvin said at argument, as opposed to what he said in his brief, he said, of course, you should look at demographic realities. He even said, you know, it would be laughable not to look at demographic realities on occasion. And I bring you back to this hypothetical question where black voters have many fewer polling stations, even though that's a completely neutral rule on its face, but the way it operates is to make voting more difficult for black voters than white voters and leave it so that they -- the political system is not equally open to their participation. And he said, sure, you can -- you can look at that. And, similarly, you talked about, like, the practical evaluation of realities on the ground. So, I mean, tell me how you think these things differ. And I guess, more specifically -- I guess, when you start thinking about a whole run of hypotheticals, there are some things that are really quite obvious burdens which you just know looking at them is going to lead to -- to real difficulty for some -- you know, to black -- for black voters or for Native American voters or for Latino voters, and then other restrictions where you can say, well, you know, that's kind of an inconvenience, but they could -- they could overcome that inconvenience if -- if they really wanted to.

I want to explore how we got here as a statutory matter and try to square up the statutory text and common sense a bit. It seems like there are two polar positions one could have reading different parts of the statute. So Section 2(a) speaks only of results. That was the House bill, of course. And that strongly supports a position that any disproportionate impact would be problematic under the statute. Of course, the Dole compromise meant that Section 2(b) was added to the statute, and that speaks of opportunity. And a polar position on that would be, as was suggested in Mr. Carvin's brief, that time, place, and manner restrictions that are race-neutral provide equal opportunity. But, as Justice Kagan pointed out, just -- Mr. Carvin alluded to demographic realities being relevant, the state attorney general also talked about the totality of the circumstances being relevant, and, of course, in Section 2(b) -- refers to the totality of the circumstances. So, to the extent we're not at either polar position, we're between pure results and pure opportunity, as defined in -- in Mr. Carvin's brief at least, and we're in totality of the circumstances, two -- two circumstances that seem to make a difference as a matter of common sense. One, as the Chief Justice pointed out, when you have the Carter-Baker Commission saying that a particular state law is a good idea as a matter of policy, that would seem to be a circumstance that is -- as a matter of common sense, would -- would lend support to the state's rule. And then, secondly, and I mentioned this earlier, when a state rule is commonplace in other states, that would seem to be a circumstance that puts a thumb on the scale in favor of the legitimacy of the state rule and it not being a reflection of discriminatory intent. And, here, the out-of-precinct policy is in something like 26 other states, including a wide variety of states, including states with no history of discrimination. So, if we get into totality of the circumstances, why don't those two things matter? And you can comment more generally on how I've outlined this."

And there's a difficulty that, you know, the statutory language and its lack of clarity presents in trying to figure out when something crosses from an inconvenience to a burden. You know, on the other side -- and I think some of the hypotheticals that Justice Alito was asking you emphasized this -- I think, you know, your position and its emphasis on any disparity at all risks saying that any election rule, you know, which, as Judge Easterbrook pointed out in his Frank opinion, you know, all election rules are going to make it easier for some to vote than others. So your approach risks ruling them all out. So let me give you an example. What about a rule that the polls close at 7 p.m. and because of socioeconomic reasons, it's harder for minority voters to get to the poll spot before 7 p.m. because of the time, you know, of their work hours in the day? Is that the kind of burden that triggers Section 2? Would that -- would such a rule -- poll closure rule, would that violate Section 2?"

What could threaten that more than the idea that you can't do anything about somebody within the reservation that you have good reason to believe is violating criminal law? It would seem to me that's the prototypical case for the exception."

You make what I think are forceful separation-of-powers arguments, particularly that Congress has provided for cross-deputization, and that was not taken advantage of here. So I take that point, and that's an important one for me. But, at the same time, a couple other thoughts that I'll throw out there, and then you can react to them. The amicus brief from the former U.S. Attorneys says that ""criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is an indefensible morass of complex, conflicting, and illogical commands layered in over decades via congressional policies and court decisions and without the consent of tribal nations."" And I don't think you're going to disagree with that description necessarily, and so that leads me to think that one of the things we should be trying to do here is -- is to do no harm because there's lots of ripple effects from a broad decision. And with that in mind, there are statements in our decisions in Duro and Strate that really cut directly against you, as you're -- you're well aware. And you can say those are dicta, and that might be correct, but those have guided the law -- law enforcement for several decades. I think Congress and the executive could reasonably rely on those statements in the Court's decision. Certainly, the Cohen treatise treats those statements as authoritative in terms of guidance. So why isn't the best thing we can do here just to stick with what we said in those cases? It's not very analytically satisfying, but it's a narrow result. It does not make a morass, as it was described, any worse. What do you think?"

I mean, on the one hand, as Justice Kavanaugh points out, it's not very analytically satisfying to rely on the dicta, particularly from the footnote in Strate. But I want to try this on -- you know, you say one problem with our -- you know, or the government's approach or an approach saying that there is some sort of retained authority to police here is that we haven't identified its scope or its source. But, you know, Montana and those cases that followed it relied pretty heavily on the unfairness of imposing tribal law on those who didn't participate in its creation. And in that respect, Strate's footnote is perfectly consistent with that because, as the United States pointed out in argument and in its brief, you know, Cooley and -- and other non-members of the tribe are represented in the creation of federal law. And so it doesn't pose that same problem here. It's -- it's far less of an unfairness, and Strate's footnote can be seen to be consistent with that principle, particularly if the United States is right that one way to understand Montana is that that is an instance of implied preemption that cashes out when you consider the assertion of authority to adjudicate finally civil or criminal liability or the imposition of regulations on those who didn't participate in its exercise. So can you explain to me why that would not be a way to reconcile the Strate footnote and the United States' proposed authority here?"

First, this structure is a real break from tradition, which we've said in cases like Free Enterprise Fund and many others, perhaps the most telling indication of a constitutional problem is the departure -- the lack of historical precedent. The lack of agency review of the ALJ decision by someone who's appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate is absent here and is ordinarily present and historically has been present. And then, second, the lack of accountability, as the Chief Justice said and Justice Gorsuch was just saying, these are multimillion, sometimes billion-dollar decisions being made not by someone who's accountable in the usual way that the Appointments Clause demands. And the director, on rehearing, does not have the unilateral power to reverse. So, you know, if Congress is going to do that, they can eliminate agency review and prevent removal at will, then it's easy to make these AL -- APJs presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed.

Just to pick up on Justice Gorsuch, this does seem, and I think you acknowledged, a -- a significant departure from general historical practice since the APA, which is a yellow flag, if not a red flag. And then your test to try to deal with that seems to resurrect Morrison v. Olson's test. I thought we'd gotten away from that in -- in Edmond. Justice Alito's questions pointed that out. And what I'm worried about -- this is the wolf. What I'm worried about is this gives a model for Congress to eliminate agency review of ALJ decisions and kind of fragment and take away from agency control going forward, because this -- however this came about, to Justice Kagan's question, this would be a model going forward, and that would allow Congress to give extraordinary power to inferior officers, which is not how our government is ordinarily structured. And then, to Justice Sotomayor's question, it seems like ALJs, there's two -- there's two fixes. You can go with the executive model of ALJs, which is the traditional have ALJs and have agency review or removability, it's usually agency review, not removability with ALJs; or you can make the APJs principal officers with presidential appointment and Senate advice and consent if you want a more judicial model.

So, you know, the federal -- well, think about -- one unusual thing about the remedy here is that it's not one specific provision in this statutory scheme that's being challenged as unconstitutional. It's the way that they work together. You know, so we could, if we decided that it was unconstitutional, perhaps make all of the APJs subject to -- say they're principal officers, and so they have to be subject to presidential appointment, senatorial confirmation. We could say, listen, we're going to strike the provision in the statute that says only the PTAB may grant rehearings so that the director has that authority. We could make them maybe at-will employees, so they're removable at the discretion of the director without having to go through the full process that we discussed before.

And the founding generation conceived of principal officers as synonymous with heads of departments. In early debates and enactments that structured executive department, heads of the department were -- were referred to as principal officers and other members as inferior officers. There's a whole history that many of those inferior officers took final decisions in a wide variety of areas. Yet that's the way we proceeded. The history also shows that early statutes gave non-principal officers the power to make final adjudicatory decisions on behalf of the executive. Your opposing counsel pointed out that as early as 1793, non-principal officers were given the power to adjudicate patent disputes, and in 1803, land commissioners were given the power to make final determinations as to a claimant's right to a tract of land. I personally read this history as suggesting that principal officers were intended to be policymakers, and individuals who merely adjudicated claims based on said policies were not principal officers. So, for me, the person that has to be held responsible is not the individual ILJ -- or ALJ who is making a decision. It's the person who creates the policy. And for me, it's clear that APJs are not policymakers. All the policies are vested in the director. Precedential power is put in the director. The ALJs cannot influence the course of the law. That's only the director. So please tell me why the individual decision based on a quasi-law precedent and policy set by the director is a final decision that that director won't be held responsible for."

And then the courts of appeals essentially pick up on Califano in this context without paying attention, in my view, to the -- to the language difference in Califano, and you see the Seventh Circuit and the Fifth, Fourth, and Third all kind of go on the call -- Califano road, also a little bit with the greater includes the lesser point. And Califano doesn't work, as I think the government itself was going to have to acknowledge here, and so they're back-filling with textual arguments on 355(f), which you've answered, and then 231g. And I just would point out -- I think this is right, but you tell me if I'm wrong -- the government has never argued in this way the 231g point in all these cases. You know, you go back and look at the briefs and it's just not been part of that, presumably, because they've long understood, the Railroad Board at least, has long understood that denials of reopening, just like grants of reopening, obviously change your benefits if it's a grant of reopening, and so a denial too determines your rights and liabilities. So I think that I guess my understanding of the history of this is quite a bit different in terms of the case law in going back to Judge Friendly's opinion and what Justice Breyer said. And you can -- I mean, that's a favorable question to you, obviously. But, if you want to fill in any gaps there, go ahead."

And it's clearly the way Justice Scalia thought he was coming to this conclusion. And the conclusion, you're right, it's not a force case, but, essentially, he's saying: Well, look, you either need force or you need submission. And he's going through the common law to suggest why those -- those requirements were not met. So I -- I guess I -- I'll just ask you again, I -- I mean, if anything other than an ultimate holding is not dicta, this is not dicta, isn't it?"

A -- a lot of your remedial argument seems to hinge on the happenstance that we had an acting director at the time of the Third Amendment's adoption. I -- I'd like to highlight two potential difficulties with that and ask for your thoughts. The first is the assumption that the acting director is answerable to the President while the director is not. Under the statute creating this outfit, the director appoints deputy directors, the director, not the President. It appears that those deputy directors would be insulated from the President therefore. And when -- when the director steps aside, he names the acting director, or, rather, he gives a pool of three of his deputies and the President chooses which of those three. But the director appointed all three of them. So I'm not sure in what sense or where we get the inference or how we generate from some penumbra emanating somewhere that the President has the removal power over this acting director. That's one. And two is, let's -- let's box in that, let's assume that's the case. So what? The -- the plaintiffs here challenged actions after -- during this whole period, including after a period in which the acting director disappeared and we now have a director. You say, well, that -- that -- that doesn't matter because the amendment is a thing that was adopted by the acting director. But the plaintiffs are challenging the director's actions as void because he is unanswerable to the President. So why wouldn't we at least be able to provide relief voiding the director's actions once we had a -- a -- a Senate-confirmed director in 2014?"

But then you went on to name multi-member agencies in the federal and civil service. And my understanding of the principle that would be applicable here would be that single director independent agencies are not historically rooted, as the Court said in Seila Law, and that's all we would be saying and applying here."

But it seems to me -- and this goes back to some of the questions that Justices Sotomayor and Kagan were pressing you on -- it seems to me that you're kind of arguing for a third ground here, which is, well, then we take a look at what is the executive official really doing.

First, the argument is that this decision was entered into by two entities under the complete control of the President. There is no dispute that the Treasury had -- treasurer is removable at will. So we know what the President would have wanted because he had an agency he fully and unequivocally controlled entering this agreement. And then, secondly, we have an acting director, which almost logically means that he could be removable entering it. Second, no President has ever tried to remove the director, acting or otherwise.

It -- it came from the categorical and modified categorical approaches. They are called categorical because they are making a categorical determination.

So you have somebody who's convicted of burglary under, let's say, California law, and the question is whether that is a conviction for generic burglary. It -- it is a -- it is a determination about an entire category of cases; that is, all of the cases prosecuted and convicted under the California burglary statute. And it is in that situation where the court asks -- looks to the least of the acts criminalized. It asks what is the least thing that could get somebody convicted of burglary in California. Would that constitute generic burglary? If the answer to that is no, then it flunks under the categorical test. But what's involved here is not categorical at all. It is the determination of a question of fact, was your client convicted under subsection (c) or was he not convicted under subsection (c)?"

Are there any other arguments you could make that your client wasn't, in fact, convicted of a CIMT?

Did you challenge that below, that that's wrong?

Was he convicted of a boat burglary or a house? And here's what it says to do: You look at the statute. Well, that doesn't help. They're all three. Then you look at the indictment or information. And then you look at the jury instructions. Now, if those three things, the statute, the jury instructions, and the -- and the indictment or information, show that this was burglary of a house, that it necessarily, we've said in about 10 cases, is burglary of a house, the government wins. And if they don't, the other side wins. Well, with slightly different words here, slightly different documents do the same thing. Does the statute forbid that? Of course not. The statute that you're talking about has words in it, and those words say that if the evidence indicates one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of relief apply, then the government wins. So we look at the listed documents, we see if they do, and that's the end of the case; if they don't necessarily show that, then he's carried his burden of proof.

Let's say this is a contract case, and the question was, what did I agree to? Now, in one sense, that's as much a factual question as this one is. And yet, because we look to the contract, when we look to the contract to determine what I agreed to, we don't think of it as a factual question anymore.

And I'll just add to this, Mr. Bond, that is the way every court in America treats it. Every court of appeals in this country uses a de novo standard in ACCA cases in order to review that determination.

So suppose one of those members said, well, here, we're going to authorize the Commission to seek an injunction, so I'm going to look at the most recent edition of Black's Law Dictionary, which defines an injunction in part as ""a judicial process operating in personam and requiring a person to whom it is directed to do or refrain from doing a particular thing.""

I think Justice Brandeis, when he started, was faced with a business community that was very suspicious of the FTC's power and thought it would be abused and a progressive community that thought it's absolutely necessary to bring bad business practices under control. So they compromised. The compromise was you've got to do what the FTC says, but before it tells you to do something, it will find that what you're doing now is wrong. It will find that. It will be a cease-and-desist order, later expanded under Moss-Magnuson, I think, to include violation of a rule. So Section 5, cease-and-desist order or violation of a rule, ha, damage of some kind. Nineteen, the same thing. And now we have right in the middle 13, no protection like that whatsoever. Do not worry, says the FTC, we will only use it in exceptional cases. Ha! In 2012, they repeal that. And now, 10 years later, after this has been in effect for a few years, I read that 100 cases under this provision are in the courts, compared with 10 or 12 under the regular cases.

Add substantiation. People wouldn't know that it is an unfair practice that a chiropractor who was married to a wife who had some income from the company and therefore is a conclusion as to the muscle toning of the company should be discounted. And that's the kind of case they're bringing now. Now do you see my point? On the one hand, it's well-established law in the lower court. On the other hand, if we interpret it your way, we -- we -- we say your fears, business community, were absolutely right. It is now up to the FTC. Before you know the thing is wrong, they hit you with bad damages. This case? Perhaps you're right. But Skechers, Cardinal, even Unburn, build strong bodies eight ways, that was Wonder Bread.

Mr. Clement, the statutory phrase that we have to interpret in this case has a structure that is fairly common. It lists two activities, ""storing or producing telephone numbers,"" followed by a modifying phrase, ""using a random or sequential number generator."" People make statements like that all the time, and, you know what, those who hear them or read them understand what they mean without looking at treatises on grammar syntax, usage, or interpretation. And the way they do that is to ask, what makes sense? I can give you lots of examples, but I have very little time for questioning, so they -- they ask about the sense of it before they get to all this arcane stuff. So the question that jumps out here is this: Does it make any sense to speak about storing a list of telephone numbers using a random or sequential number generator? And the best answer I can find in the briefs on your side is that there were systems that produced lists of numbers using such a generator and then stored them. But, unless you can explain how a generator was used in the very process of storing the numbers, I think you have a problem."

That part of the statute's not obsolete at all. And that part of the statute, even if you were to lose, will still operate to prohibit prerecorded or artificial calls to the home or to cell phones unless an exception applies, correct?"

And, further, I mean, Voisine spends as -- as much time talking about the effects of coming out the other way than it does about the text. In other words, it basically says, if we don't hold the way we are holding today, this entire federal scheme will be rendered inoperative. And -- and that seems very different no matter if you can come up with, you know, 13 robbery statutes or -- or something like that, that seems an extremely different consequence of a ruling. So I guess I would ask you to respond to that set of things that might serve to distinguish this case from Voisine."

I -- I guess one other possible distinction textually between this and Voisine, of course, is that we don't have the phrase ""against the person or property of another."" And I know -- in that case and we do here. And in Leocal, I -- I guess I'm still stuck. You -- you -- you don't seem to want us to read very much into that phrase, but Leocal says whether or not the word ""use"" alone supplies a mens rea element, the parties' primary focus on that word is too narrow. Then it goes on to say, ""the key phrase -- 'use of physical force against the person or property of another' -- most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental."" Suggesting that phrase has some work to do in mens rea. And I guess I'm still struggling with how, if we're to take our precedent seriously, we ignore that construction, which isn't present in Voisine, irrelevant in Voisine."

And if -- if we can't make heads or tails of it and every circuit to have addressed it up until recently came out against you, why shouldn't we -- if Congress wishes to legislate here further, and, of course, it may, why shouldn't we here say the tie goes to the defendant, the presumptively free defendant?"

And in your brief, I -- I thought the answer that you were giving about the distinction of Leocal -- and this is page 13 of your brief -- ""The Court in Voisine accordingly made clear that the critical distinction recognized in Leocal itself is between accidents and recklessness, not recklessness and knowledge or intention."" In other words, that Leocal stands for the idea that negligence doesn't come within this kind of language. Is that right?"

Well, so -- so I'm sorry to interrupt, but the -- the point being that Leocal recognizes the distinction that's traditional: Negligence, out; recklessness and above, per model penal code, is usually considered more important. But you don't have to guess because you have Voisine, I guess, that draws that distinction. And so that's what I thought the distinction was between Leocal and Voisine, but -- as your brief said. The other thing I wanted to get to is the notice point has been raised here. And it seems to me that the notice in this kind of statute is a little bit different, but -- and this is more of a comment, and you can fill in the gaps of it. But we're not talking about notice for committing reckless assault under Tennessee law. What we're talking about is someone who's been convicted three times for separate offenses under Tennessee law, or other state law, who then, after being convicted of three violent felonies, knowing they shouldn't possess firearms, nonetheless possesses firearms on notice they shouldn't possess firearms because they've been convicted of these prior offenses. So you actually have to four times have committed some pretty significant violation before you fall into this statute. Is that -- I mean, that's my understanding, and I think that's the important point on notice, but you can elaborate if you wish."

Second, FOIA officers, who are rampant throughout the executive branch, spend an enormous amount of time and resources on FOIA, could use clarity. And then district court judges in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, if you talk to, would lament the lack of clarity and clear rules in -- in FOIA cases.

And in this case, you know, there's a black defendant. The state uses its peremptory strikes to strike all but one black juror -- uses four of its six peremptories against black venire persons -- strikes five blacks for cause because several of them -- in part, for several of them -- had a family history of incarceration. And you're left with one black juror with a black defendant. Then you get a 11-to-1 verdict on the armed robbery count, the two kidnapping counts -- one of the armed robbery counts, two kidnapping counts, and the rape count. And the one juror is the black -- black woman, the black juror.

As I understand it, the -- the CB -- the CBO report predicted that only a small number of people would do that, the exact opposite of what it said in 2009, because of a willingness to comply with law. But you have to take it a step further. You have to prove that those -- that small number would include people who didn't enroll for Medicaid and didn't enroll for CHIPs when it was a legal requirement as a tax, but they would do so now after they're told there's no penalty for it, there's no tax for it. At some point, common sense seems to me would say: Huh? There's only a small number of people who would do it. That small number of people have to include Medicaid and CHIP recipients to affect you as the state at all.

They could only be asked to make a choice under the tax clause. Now the individual plaintiffs here still believe that there's a command, contrary to what NFIB said, that they must buy health insurance.

And you conceded that would be sufficient, but you resisted it.

And given all of the circumstances or potential circumstances, some of which are just like this case, that Justice Alito mentioned, your defendant was just released from prison six months before he was arrested for this charge, and he had served either 20 months or 36 months, it's impossible to believe that there's any reasonable doubt that he could have put his knowledge in contention. So why am I looking at this the wrong way?"

Certainly, if, on prong 4, the record did show some contravention at the sentencing hearing or, et cetera, that mental health was at issue, the appellate court could look at that. But I take -- I go a step further. Assuming that because nobody thought knowledge was at issue, that evidence had never made it into the record, I'm not sure that you could present it. As I see Federal Rule 10 -- Federal Appellate Procedure Rule 10(e)(2)(C), it only allows for corrections of errors in the record to bring in new evidence only if it was in error, and you can -- and the court can take judicial notice of undisputed facts, but if there's something that's not in the record at all, and I'm talking just the trial record, but not there at all, and it's something you didn't put in because you didn't know it would be at issue, do you know of any way for you to get it before the appellate court?"

But, on your rule, on the broad rule, the defendant can get a bare record if he just stays silent. And, you know, usually a bare record will mean reversal. So wouldn't that approach give the defendant an incentive not to object?

That at least has to be the theory.

In your view, do steps 3 and 4 do anything distinct? Because then the government pointed out, and I think many of the questions you've gotten show, that step 3 maybe has a jury focus, but step 4 doesn't have anything to do with what the jury would think. It has to do more with what the public would think. Do you see them as having any kind of different function or, essentially, under your analysis, we just stop at step 3 because, if it would have led to a different result, then there's no need really to do anything different in step 4?"

Why should we not adhere to the basic interpretive principle that counsels in favor of a harmonious reading and against choosing an interpretation that produces a substantial effect that is inconsistent with the text of another provision?

I wanted to give you my thought about how I'm looking at this and get your reaction. So, on the tax, I see this as a Subchapter 68 penalty that, therefore, qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. On Direct Marketing, it seems to me that that's arguably distinct because the penalty there was not a tax. Here, it is so defined as a tax and, therefore, comes within the scope of the Anti-Injunction Act. Then we get to the question -- and there's -- and there's other questions -- but the regulatory tax question, the Bob Jones and Alexander cases, and I want to get your reaction to this, which is I think reading those cases as they are poses a problem for you, but I'm not sure those cases are -- should be read for all they're worth. In other words, I'm wondering whether those cases -- we should back away from some of the implications of those cases for challenges to regulatory taxes for the reasons, some of the reasons you've given here, that it seems somewhat unfair, as it did even in those cases, somewhat unfair to force someone to go through the process that you're talking about here.

I'm going to tell you where I'm -- I think I'm with you and where I think I have a problem. On the text of the Anti-Injunction Act, I think you have a strong argument, Subchapter 68 and how that fits here. This penalty is designated a tax; therefore, it fits within the AIA. Direct Marketing, I think you have a good point. That was not subject -- that penalty was not denominated a tax and, therefore, the reason the two cases would be different is that the text of the statutes is different. You make a good point there, I think. In terms of the Regan point, how you would do this, you say you file a letter objecting to it, and you then have post- -- you have proceedings after the IRS assesses the penalty. That all makes sense to me as well. The criminal point, Justice Alito's point, you just said the Court could flat-out say that it's not a willful violation when you're challenging the reporting requirement being unlawful. So that -- we could -- we could say that. Here's where I think I have a concern: On Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander, those cases, you were having a discussion with Justice Kagan, either/or, are you challenging the regulatory aspect of this or the reporting aspect of this, or are you challenging the tax aspect? I think you're challenging both as a plaintiff really. And what Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander seem to say -- and this supports you -- is that when you're doing that, you have to go -- the AIA applies. And I -- I agree with you that those cases support you. But I also think Justice Gorsuch makes a very good point that the current philosophy that's -- those cases are from a different era. The current philosophy of challenging administrative action is different, as the Chief Justice said, with presumptions. And, here, where I really think Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander may be different is when the penalties are so high if you lose. In other words, you have to bet, and if you bet and lose, penalties are so high that it's going to deter you from challenging the regulatory or reporting aspect in the first place. So the bottom -- long-wind up, bottom-line question. Shouldn't -- as a matter of fairness, modern era of administrative law, presumptions, shouldn't we carve out an exception from Bob Jones, Alexander, Bailey, when the penalties for trying to challenge something are so high that it's going to be coercive and effectively deter you from bringing this kind of challenge in the first place?"

What AT&T says is, but that is a question of arbitrability. It is a question whether this dispute is arbitrable. So it's for the judge. But where there is an arbitration clause in the contract, as there was in First Options as far as the owners knew, but where there is a -- where there is an arbitration clause, then there is a presumption of arbitrability. All right? So that seems to me, Judge, you decide. You decide whether this particular dispute is sent to an arbitrator or -- or for the court, i.e., is it arbitrable, you decide, Judge, but if there's an arbitration clause in the contract, you decide with the presumption of arbitrability that it will normally be arbitrable. That's what it seems to say. And so the judge was right to decide it below, but he didn't decide it right because he should have given it a presumption of arbitrability. Now that's how I read those two cases, but also in the back of my mind is what in heaven's name happens in labor arbitration. In the ordinary labor arbitration case -- and that's where all this law comes from -- where -- one party, the labor union, says this is a Section 8 agreement, arbitrate it. No, says the employer.

When you have a carveout and the parties have taken pains to say this subject, we don't want the arbitrator to have anything to do with this subject, we want the judge to decide this because the judge -- we want -- this is something that needs to be decided in accordance with the law, and we know that arbitrators have a lot more leeway in interpreting -- in interpreting contracts.

When you look at the AAA rules, Rule 7(a) says, ""the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.""

So courts will decide whether certain things are arbitrable or not, and arbitrators will decide whether other things are arbitrable. I think that's what you're saying.

In other words, they're ways to try to determine legal rights going forward before the declaratory judgment form existed. The second group of cases are cases in which there's injury that's hard to monetize, and -- and these cases are asking for something to recompense that injury. But the reason why those cases aren't very relevant anymore is that, in our world, we monetize those claims all the time. We now live in a world, unlike the historical world, in which we acknowledge claims for emotional distress, claims for dignitary harms of all kinds, which makes the nominal damages claim unnecessary. The third group of cases is a case in which what the plaintiff really wants is vindication. It's a statement that I'm right, the defendant is wrong.

He was constitutional -- unconstitutionally forbidden to do it. Well, he was about to give his speech. What's the damage? Now don't nominal damages have a place right there where there is damage, but it's just impossible to measure?"

But it seems to me that, in your responses to Justice Alito's questions, Justice Kagan's questions, Justice Gorsuch's questions, you've kind of gone back and forth on the triviality of the money point.

I'm a bit mystified by some of the arguments here because it seems like you're asking us to reinvent the wheel, but it's not a new issue at least as I see it. We decided unanimously in 1956 how to balance property rights against union organizing rights in the Babcock case. And then, of course, in Lechmere, we reiterated that in Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court there. The Babcock briefs, if you go back into those, those are all about property rights against union organizing rights, and then Babcock considers that and -- and sets forth a rule. Now I think you -- you probably prevail under that rule, but I'm -- I'm curious why your argument is not as simple as Justice Clark's -- California Supreme Court Justice Clark's argument in his dissent in the '76 case that you cite where he just says, under Babcock, there's a rule, the Board's regulation here goes beyond the Babcock rule by permitting blanket access under private -- onto private property during worker -- working hours and access when alternative means of communications do, in fact, exist. The regulation is, therefore, unconstitutional. Why is it not as simple as that?"

So, in other words, it seems to me, especially if you go back into the briefs in Babcock, which are all about the Fifth Amendment -- not all about, but they talk a lot about the Fifth Amendment -- that then you read Babcock, it is interpreting the statute as informed by the Constitution and saying, given the constitutional status of the property rights, we're only going to allow this very limited intrusion, again, as Justice Clark says for the California Supreme Court, when alternative means of communication do, in fact, exist, then you can't go onto the property.

That's a question of whether there's a regulatory taking and whether it went too far. This is the kind of taking that it, no matter what, requires compensation under the Fifth Amendment. It is a Fifth Amendment taking because it's a classical property interest. We have previously defined or sort of said that that kind of interest has to be a taking that is continuous and indefinite, like taking even an inch of somebody's apartment house to put up a CATV system or taking an easement for the beach. The virtue of their approach is that it's pretty clear, I think, because, otherwise, you get into the mess of saying, well, what about a year? Here, it's 4 percent of all the year's hours and 10 percent or 12 percent of all the daylight hours and -- and -- but it is not government coming in, it's a private person coming in. That's what they say. So what are the rules that distinguish an easement from not?

And so the issue is, can the police, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the ability to ask the wife whether she would consent to giving up the gun and ammunition, that they decided on their own to go in and seize the gun.

There's a heightened risk that this person is going to sneak away before the house can be surrounded. One of the briefs says it takes six to eight officers to surround the house waiting for a warrant.

Part of the problem is that what are felonies are no longer absolutely, necessarily, and in all situations dangerous crimes. You can have white-collar crimes where there is no danger. You can have all sorts of environmental crimes, other things that don't cause -- that don't create exigency in the same sense that Santana was announcing the rule or that the common law came from. And so I don't know why anybody is arguing that there's a difference between felony and misdemeanors and why we're recognizing a categorical rule at all. Why isn't the better reading just that hot pursuit is a type of exigent circumstance that can but does not always justify warrantless entry, regardless of whether the underlying offense is a felony or misdemeanor? If you look at our holding in Santana, we talked about all of the circumstances that would make it likely that a drug dealer would destroy evidence once they saw the police officer on -- on the scene. Our next case, Stanton, was not about whether or not the issue was a felony or not. It was -- the issue was, was the situation such as to justify, reasonably, entry? So I guess what I'm asking is, why don't we just announce the rule that I stated, that exigency can but doesn't always, whether it's a misdemeanor or a felony, justify a warrantless entry?"

I mean, sometimes it is, but a lot of times it's not. And that -- the violence and dangerous aspect of -- of the conduct seems the more relevant one for purposes of deciding when an intrusion into the home is proper.

And, second, we live in a world in which everything has been criminalized. And some professors have even opined that there's not an American alive who hasn't committed a felony in some -- under some state law.

I guess that cuts both ways, though, because one could say, well, you don't need a categorical rule because you already have the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine that covers all the things that justify the categorical rule.

The other option's a categorical rule for both. And I asked Ms. Rice about this, what would be the difference in the real world. She said, as you said, clear rules for officers. But I wonder if the exigent circumstances doctrine, in other words, the first option, really wouldn't provide, you know, not as clear a rule but still a pretty clear rule for officers because the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine really, as I see it, tracks common sense, these are the kinds of cases and the kinds of reasons an officer would do this in the first place, want to go into the house without a warrant, especially escape of the suspect, threats to others, destruction of evidence.

I want to focus on the facts of this case a bit and -- and my reaction to it. As you say and I think helpful for you, the context here is a team and a coach, not the school more generally. But, as a judge and maybe as a coach and a parent too, it seems like maybe a bit of over -- overreaction by the coach. So my reaction when I read this, she's competitive, she cares, she blew off steam like millions of other kids have when they're disappointed about being cut from the high school team or not being in the starting lineup or not making all league. And just by way of comparison about -- and to show how much it means to people, you know, arguably, the greatest basketball player of all time is inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009 and gives a speech, and what does he talk about? He talks about getting cut as a sophomore from the varsity team. And he wasn't joking. He was critical 30 years later. It still -- it still bothered him. And I think that's just emblematic of how much it means to kids to make a high school team. It is so important to their lives, and coaches sweat the cuts, and it guts coaches to have to cut a kid who's on the bubble, and -- and good coaches understand the importance and they understand the emotions. So maybe what bothers me when I read all this is that it didn't seem like the punishment was tailored to the offense given what I just said about how important it is and you know how much it means to the kids. I mean, a year's suspension from the team just seems excessive to me. But how does that fit into the First Amendment doctrine or does it fit in at all in a case like this?"

And so what you're asking us to do is to extend the school's authority that Tinker acknowledges outside of the school environment. And I think you have good policy reasons for doing that. You know, I think harassment, bullying, and I think threats of violence against the school and cheating are all things that would be of concern.

You know, it's not going to be easy to apply, and I think a lot of the questions that you've gotten today show a concern, including in this case, that schools abuse this authority and that they punish things that maybe don't cause substantial disruption or political speech or religious speech that they shouldn't or -- you know, I think you've heard a lot of skepticism about whether the speech at issue in this case actually caused substantial disruption. So I -- I -- I -- I guess my concern is, if we have two -- two tests being offered or on offer, neither one is going to be easy to apply in all cases, they'll both have hard cases, which one ought we apply? Which one is the more protective of speech?

A few years ago, a superintendent of schools, I think in San Francisco, said, you know, schools have changed a lot, public schools, since when I went there. He said, today we don't just teach classical subjects. We're there to help the child have adequate health, in many cases, to see that he's adequately fed. In quite a few cases, we become a caretaker, and we don't want to send them home immediately because there's nobody home, and we have to plan after-school activities. There are dozens of areas that didn't used to be thought of as within the purview of the public school. Today, in many places, they are. Now add to that the Internet and the Internet not just listening to teachers but also doing homework and also writing papers, sometimes vaguely defined and sometimes and sometimes. How do I get a standard out of that? I'm frightened to death of writing a standard. And Tinker, after all, doesn't really write a standard. It just says you can't regulate school unless it substantially disrupts or hurts somebody else. It doesn't say if it does that you can do anything you want. You still must use some kind of test, like proportionality or something else, and I can mention that often outside of school it's the parents' job, not the teachers' if, by the way, there are parents in the house, et cetera, and I can mention the differences and say take those into account.

If we're going to address the broad issues, then I, for one, think we need clear rules that protect freedom of speech. On the other hand, if the Court, having decided to take this case, wants to decide it without addressing those broad issues, of course, the Court could dismiss the case, and I assume you wouldn't have an objection to that. But, if the Court doesn't do that, could the Court do something along these lines: Say Tinker applies in school. It says nothing one way or the other about what a school may or may not do to student speech outside the school. We look at the particular comments made here. They're made in colorful language, but, substantively, they boil down to something like, I have no respect for the school, I have no respect for the cheer squad, I hate the school, I hate the cheer squad, I also hate my private softball team.

Now Mr. Cole said the case law allows us to act like Soviets and the North -- North Koreans.

I think Mr. Cole said it's the Tinker test, but he's afraid to use the Tinker word because it's scary, and it shouldn't be. You're much better off cleaning this doctrine up. Justice Kagan, you had amazing questions about school speech. Remember, our test is the audience has to be the school, so all of your speech, if it's to the press, the police, your pastor, your family, et cetera, none of that is school speech even if it involves a school topic. Justice Barrett, on threats, the facts in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Bell, nobody knew whether that was a threat. The police were sort of involved. It is not fair to the parents of those other kids to have schools fumbling around. Well, I don't know what this applies before we had Tinker, part of the threats were on campus, part were off, it was on the Internet. Let's look at where she drafted it, maybe she was to and from. Now let's move to the school supervision: madness, confusion, and chaos. Please don't do this to schools. Mr. Cole said you could prevent swearing to and from school. That's nuts. You're in the dad's minivan. That's school supervision under their view. No one thinks Fraser applied there, and yet all of a sudden, when you get out of the minivan and I guess walking to it, it maybe depends on how fair you park, Tinker is going in and out of coverage, that rule makes no sense. There's no case law on conduct that aids and abets school speech. You will have a school speech petition.

That seemed like a very reasonable way to handle the situation. But TransUnion didn't ask for such a form. It didn't object to Mr. Ramirez's testimony or seek discovery from absent class members.

In response to Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch, I think you were saying -- but tell me if I'm wrong -- that the risk of harm is still not enough for damages unless the risk of harm is itself a separate harm. In other words, the risk of harm is not cancer, in other words, you don't have the cancer, but the risk of harm may create emotional injury. Is that an accurate way to summarize what you're saying?"

She asked you to distinguish between what would happen if they filed within the five-year period in which they would know whether the risk had materialized or outside the five-year period, say in the sixth year. I want to know what would happen, say, if they filed in year two, but the litigation drags on and on and on and the case doesn't come to its conclusion until year six. So, if I understand your response to Justice Kagan, it would essentially mean that people had standing at the outset of the suit. But, if they were in the 50 percent that were home-free, they would lose their standing by the end? I mean, that just seems like an odd way to think about it since we normally judge standing at the outset, and when something dissipates over the course of a suit, we think about it in terms of mootness, not that the injury isn't concrete.

And it seems like this case is about whether, even going beyond that, a big risk that the tort would actually happen to you is itself a tort. And I -- I haven't heard you disclaim that as a proper reading of Spokeo.

I think you have a good argument with respect to the 1,853 in terms of the reasonable procedures, but I'm more concerned about the 6,332, whose information was not, in essence, published. Under -- in Spokeo, of course, the information was published, which is a big distinction, as I see it, between that case and this, as to the 6,332. And when Spokeo talked then about risk of harm, it was talking about harm beyond the publication, at least as I understood it, for example, publication of ZIP codes, which strikes me as a very different thing than risk -- talking about risk of harm when there hasn't been publication to begin with. So that -- that's point one. And then, on -- on risk of harm, you heard me talk about damages versus injunctive relief. It strikes me that risk of harm, of course, is enough to get you injunctive relief. With damages, I -- I hadn't thought risk of harm would get you damages -- standing for damages claims unless the risk of harm was itself a harm. Judge Tatel in the D.C. Circuit analogized it: If inaccurate information falls into a database, does it make a sound? And his answer to that, applying Stoke -- Spokeo, was no. And I guess then-Judge Barrett, talking about no harm/no foul, seemed to be picking up on the same thing. So can you respond to the distinction between this case and Spokeo and then try to help me on risk of harm for the 6,332?"

That suggests some kind of discretion. What is that discretion that's taking place in the district court?

So I gather that you're not really denying that the district court, through 1924, has some authority to reduce when it reviews the costs for excessive copying, et cetera, but just that in this particular case of the supersedeas bond, that it doesn't have the authority to reduce it because the time for that particular cost has come and gone.

B says the tabulation of the population that he just took, as required for the apportionment of representatives, that tabulation shall be reported to the Secretary -- by the Secretary to the President. That's the report we're concerned about. That's the tabulation we're concerned about.

So we're not interested in other ways. We're interested in this report, in this tabulation, under 141(b). Now, if I'm right so far, the President's order says I'll tell you why I want that. I want that because it's our policy that illegal aliens will not be included in the census. I can't tell you exactly what ones. It doesn't say that. It just says illegal aliens will not be included. And he asked for the report so he can do that. Now, if the Constitution forbids him to, or if the statutes forbid him to, subtract from the tabulation for purposes of the statement, if it forbids him to subtract those illegal aliens, or to the extent it does, the tabulation and the report are not the tabulation required for the apportionment of the census and, therefore, he cannot ask -- he cannot ask the Secretary for that report to contain that information.

It could be that we are dealing with a possibility that is quite important. It could be that this is much ado about very little. It depends on what the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce are able to do. If I just take the numbers from the district court in D.C.'s opinion last week, they said that the -- the plaintiffs in that case were claiming that there are 10.5 million people in this country who would be counted as being here illegally. But, if you look at the smaller number of -- of those who are held in detention facilities, it's -- it's something like 60,000. The first number could easily change the apportionment of representatives. The second one, it's much more doubtful that it would change the apportionment of representatives. There are only 31 days left in the year. To exclude the 10.5 million seems to me a monumental task, to do that without sampling, to take 300 million plus names and determine individually for each of those people whether they are lawfully in the United States.

First of all, you're not saying, as to judicial review, not now, not ever. You're just saying not now as I understand it. But, as Justice Breyer indicated, the posture of this will change after the President transmits the statement, and there's a question about injunctive relief against the President.

It acknowledged its existence and allowed the challenges over the scope of the -- of the patent. Scott Paper called it a logical embarrassment. Lear said that Scott had undermined the basis for patent estoppel even more than Westinghouse had. So it read Westinghouse as undermining the basis for patent estoppel. The world has changed greatly since then, as Justice Breyer pointed out, in terms of employee/employer relations and how these contracts of adhesions are often used against employees. And now we have the Patent Office itself refusing to apply patent estoppel in its own proceedings, for -- in IPR proceedings. So the only place left that this doctrine seems to apply is in court.

They have programs that bring in billions of dollars. As Justice Thomas mentioned, the -- this money funds enormous salaries for coaches and others in huge athletic departments. But the athletes themselves have a pretty hard life. They face training requirements that leave little time or energy for study, constant pressure to put sports above study, pressure to drop out of hard majors and hard classes, really shockingly low graduation rates. Only a tiny percentage ever go on to make any money in professional sports. So the argument is they are recruited, they're used up, and then they're cast aside without even a college degree.

The -- the -- the other side's experts found on the basis of survey evidence and so forth that payments of $10,000 or more would not affect demand.

And we usually give that a pretty quick look, maybe even a twinkling of the eye. So that all -- that all makes sense to me, and we certainly don't want to go back to the bad old days of reviewing any joint venture agreement that restricts competition through per se analysis or -- or something that looks like a strict scrutiny analysis, which I understand you condemn the -- the Ninth Circuit for doing. So I understand all of that. I think the trick comes for me at least sort of where Justice Kagan was alluding to, which is, here, the agreement that's really at the center of the case is an agreement among competitors to fix price with the labor market, where you have monopsony control, and that's unusual. The normal joint venture is -- is in a competitive market. But, here, the NCAA has monopsony control over labor price.

I want to pick up from Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch and identify some issues of concern to me as I look at this. I start from the idea that the antitrust laws should not be a cover for exploitation of the student-athletes, so that is a concern, a overarching concern here. I see your rhetoric and tradition and history argument being very similar to the arguments that were made for exempting baseball from the antitrust laws, Flood v. Kuhn, Federal -- Federal Baseball, and that -- that exemption has not been replicated in other sports in other cases. And then, in Regents, as Justice Kagan said, that really was from a different era, it -- it was dicta, not sure it was fully considered dicta, and, in any event, from a different era. So then we get to regular antitrust law, rule of reason, and I just want to drill down on your asserted procompetitive justification and how you say the product is differentiated. It does seem, as Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch suggested, Justice Alito, that schools are conspiring with competitors, agreeing with competitors, I'll say that, to pay no salaries to the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing. And that just seems entirely circular and even somewhat disturbing. And then, as Justice Kagan says, it's not even factually supported in the record in this case. It seems to blend back to the tradition argument, and all things circle back to this idea, well, it should just -- just don't worry about it, college athletics is different, just like baseball.

It punishes people for 20 years or for 30 years if they commit a felony, for example, of any drug, Schedule I, Schedule II, plus two others, any drug, any of those drugs with intent to distribute it.

And, therefore, he falls within the second sentence, 30-year maximum. Then we look to the guidelines. The guidelines say a career offender -- that's what he was -- is sentenced at level 34, category 6. Okay? Now he was sentenced at level 34, category 6 with some modifications to get the sentence down. That's a very high level. Now let's imagine Mr. Terry being sentenced exactly the same way after the change. Why would there be a difference? The only difference could be in the propensity of the judge to depart from the guidelines, to depart downward. And I don't see why. This statute punishes people who are career offenders as applied to him, whether it's methamphetamine, whether it's cocaine, or whether it's crack.

Think of the first. Was that person, on your reading, prevented from asking for a lower sentence? Now, remember, the AUSA thought these high sentences are ridiculous, so the AUSA brought it under (C) and not (A) and (B) and said we don't know how much drugs there are, but the judge found out in the pre-sentence report and used the table. Can that person challenge his sentence? Yes. Why? Not under this statute, but because the Sentencing Commission reduced his sentence to reflect the change in the First Step Act. So he's free, all those people, to be resentenced. Now what about the second sentence? The second sentence has to do with career offenders.

And so one is the, you know, relatively small amount. Justice Sotomayor alluded to this. I asked about the cost. Fifty dollars. And assume it's a few hundred dollars, it's still a low amount that we're talking about here, not the kind of situation that I think most -- most people have in mind when they think about lengthy sentences for -- for federal sentencing. So that's one. Two is the history of the disparity, the crack powder disparity. This all kind of stems to June 19, 1986, when Len Bias died, and that was a shocking event, particularly in this area, particularly for those of us who -- you know, I was a year younger than he was, looked up to him, like everyone in this area did, and that was a shocking event in this area and -- and ultimately in the country at large and prompted Congress, along with other things, but that was really the proximate cause of Congress moving to establish the 100-to-1 ratio, even though that was a powder situation in the Len Bias situation, the 100-to-1 disparity is ushered into the law, and then there are racial disparities, of course, that develop over time, and Congress really has been working now for 35 years hearing about this and working to claw that back. So that -- that's something we should be thinking about, I think the other side would say. And then the third, which we've touched on, is the reality of sentencing judges and how they really, in practice -- I take Justice Breyer's point that some of them in some cases are going to think differently about this when they're close to the limit of five versus not close to the 28.

You know, this is very technical stuff here, but, as I understood it, and correct me if I'm wrong, there's some water that belongs to Texas. It hasn't got to Texas yet. And for whatever reason, I thought probably because Texas asked, New Mexico stores it in a reservoir, and then some of that evaporates. So the question is, is Texas given a debit for the amount that had belonged to Texas, the evaporated water, which you can't get because it's in the sky. And the River Master says yes. That seems to make sense. That's why we appoint River Masters, to figure those things out. You say: Oh, no, nothing in the contract allows -- nothing in the -- you know, the basic document here, the agreement, the compact, nothing allows that. Well, the SG says: Go read how they did it. They did it according to the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee, and that's how they decided that evaporation question. That seems right. And then he pointed to VI(c), which says, unless there's a more feasible method, you ought to use the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee. And that's what the -- that's what he used. So I understood this very simply. The water's gone. It evaporated. They go to the Advisory Committee's report. They use that and say the evaporated water is Texas's.
