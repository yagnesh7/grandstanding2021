12-1036,20,403.877,409.72,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr,scotus_justice,26,5.843,But I'm not sure why that -- why it wouldn't make sense to read two different terms in the same sentence to mean two different things.,12

Isn't there an overlap between those two claims, and how do we sort out -- you said -- at one point I think you described the restitution as “ disgorgement of ill gotten gains ”.",12

It's going to have to pay twice. It's going to have to pay consumers, and then it's going to have to pay you because you can: Say, well, we want restitution and we are not going to distribute it to the class members, but we're entitled to it. And I assume the amount of the restitution is based on some estimate of the class, the consumers' claims.",12

We know how the trial is going to work out or we know what the settlement is going to look like, and we are going to get the same amount of money for the State?",12

12-1036,56,1093.911,1112.733,John_G_Roberts_Jr,scotus_justice,64,18.822,"So the answer is that there is nothing to prevent 50 attorneys general, 51, from saying, every time there is a successful class action as to which somebody in my State purchased one of the items, we are going to file a parens patriae action, the complaint is going to look an awful lot like the class action complaint, and we want our money?",12
12-1036,58,1127.01,1128.4,Anthony_M_Kennedy,scotus_justice,7,1.39,"Well, that means that it could happen?",12

That's the State interest, protecting its consumers.",12
12-1036,62,1187.923,1204.714,Anthony_M_Kennedy,scotus_justice,65,16.791,"Well, as a matter of efficiency, take the Chief Justice's hypo, the hypothetical and back it up. The moment the class is certified, why can't the attorney general join it and say, now, our interest is a little different, but it's so much the same that we want to join it, and we want to join it as parens patriae. Would that prevent its removal?",12
12-1036,64,1275.067,1283.642,John_G_Roberts_Jr,scotus_justice,26,8.575,"But you can't provide any reason why they wouldn't do so, and presumably would start doing so with greater frequency if you prevail in this case.",12

12-1036,86,1683.706,1710.29,Sonia_Sotomayor,scotus_justice,59,26.584,"So how do you remand a case when it involves unnamed plaintiffs? Not a proposed class, because you -- if you have a proposed class, that could be persons, and you could identify those. But under your theory, what does a court do to figure out which of all of those unnamed people have claims above or below $75,000?",12
12-1036,88,1757.082,1764.626,Sonia_Sotomayor,scotus_justice,19,7.544,"You know, this language is very reminiscent in what's in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, the joinder rule.",12
12-1036,90,1765.907,1778.5,Sonia_Sotomayor,scotus_justice,34,12.593,"And if I look at the joinder rule, it uses “ persons ” and “ plaintiffs ” essentially in the same way. It's talking about persons being proposed plaintiffs as opposed to unnamed people--",12
12-1036,92,1779.671,1782.562,Sonia_Sotomayor,scotus_justice,6,2.891,--or the proposed class in essence.,12
12-1036,94,1840.477,1845.348,Sonia_Sotomayor,scotus_justice,16,4.871,"It seems that that would be hard, to invoke that case when a statute commands differently.",12

12-1036,104,1993.185,1994.572,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,10,1.387,Yes. All right. So this is a State law case.,12

12-1036,108,2007.402,2017.236,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,25,9.834,All right. So you have a double dip claim. I guess my question procedurally is that here the State of Mississippi is the named plaintiff.,12
12-1036,110,2018.203,2067.948,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,128,49.745,"And moreover, the State of Mississippi is suing in order to obtain money, is what we just heard, for its treasury. And third, the State of Mississippi is suing because of their belief that the defendants injured the economy of Mississippi and they injured it by hurting the pocketbooks of many individuals in Mississippi, the names of whom they don't even know. All right? Now, they say, look at -- read the statute. Read the cases which say if you are a nominal plaintiff, that's good enough as long as you are not suing as some kind of -- I forget the words -- quasi-sovereign, whatever it was, one way or the other. You know the cases better than I. But why isn't what they just said sufficient?",12

And so now we will get into the instantly interesting, but very difficult question of well, when you say hurt your citizens, do you mean hurt them by giving them rise to an independent cause of action for each of them, who we don't know who they are and we don't know if the statute of limitations has run to some, and we don't know if others have other disabilities; but, nonetheless, we're not certain this suit is entirely for that.

Let me press -- at the risk of repetition, the reason I'm asking this question is the record is not developed. I looked at the Google maps. It looked to me like this area is sort of a suburban house with a lawn in front of it, and you drive along the street, and you suspect that the street may belong to the city a little way up the lawn; but beyond that, it probably belongs to the homeowner. And when you try to see where does the green line cross that grassy area, you can't easily tell, and -- and it may be just a foot or two. So it may have been inconceivable that your client didn't cross the green line or maybe he didn't. I don't know. So, therefore, you're back to a more basic test, and you say, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that, if they do not have exclusive control, the military can't enforce this statute. But what do we do, which was my question, about instances where the military does not have exclusive control, but the reason it doesn't has nothing to do with roads, nothing to do with green lines, it has to do with thousands of other easements that have nothing to do with this case; therefore, I'm pressing you to get a definition of this statute that will serve your ends without getting into all these other kinds of easements.",12

That is the -- this is not meant to be rude. I'm trying to figure out where this idea of the consent thing comes from. After all, it apparently comes from our Korean treaty and maybe one other, but I can't find it in -- I can't find -- the question in the case is, is this particular agreement, namely an agreement to go to the court first -- shall we count it as that kind of matter as to whether this is arbitrable that goes to a judge? Or rather is it that kind of procedural Howsam, Wiley type thing that goes to an arbitrator. Now, we did our best I think to try to explain how to distinguish the one from the other in our precedent. Now, you use different words. You use these words about “ consent ”, which doesn't appear anywhere in this treaty, but I think you are trying to get at the same thing.

All right? And the government says, quite sincerely: If we had known that they were going to do that, we never would have agreed. I am trying to get an example of something that is as purely procedural as I can imagine, something no one in his right mind would think a judge, rather than an arbitrator, should decide. But under your rule, you're going to say the judges decide that and not the arbitrators, and that is what is bothering me about your rule.",12

Of course, you're right in many countries. The question of arbitrability, that is to say, is there a contract is for the Court. In an investment treaty, I can find a lot of authority that says whether this counts as an investment is a matter for the Court. But the question in front of us, is this that kind of decision? Is it one for the Court? Or is it one for the arbitrator? And to just summarize why it might be for the arbitrator, A, it's procedural but that's not sufficient.

That's the side of the line it falls on. So my question to you is: Why should this be any different? You're treating yourself as though you never made an agreement. But, in fact, you did make an important agreement. You made an agreement with the U.K., the entire point and purpose of which was to allow U.K. citizens to bring certain kinds of disputes before an arbitrator.

So maybe it's overruled by the -- the dean of -- by a dean, or maybe it's overruled by the president of the university. Maybe it's overruled by the regents.

So if they delegate most admissions decisions, as I understand from the record, to the faculty, but they still regularly, besides race, veto some of those decisions, and race is now one of them, then the Board of Regents can do that normally. So could the president, if that's the way it's normally done.
